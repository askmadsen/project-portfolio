# Project Portfolio

A curated collection of my academic and personal projects in computer science, showcased through a GitHub Pages site.

## About

This repository contains a range of projects demonstrating my skills and learning journey in computer science.  
Projects include academic coursework (Python exercises, data structures, algorithms) as well as personal explorations in web development, machine learning, and other domains.  
The portfolio is hosted as a [GitHub Pages site](https://askmadsen.github.io/project-portfolio/) for easy browsing and demonstration.
